Educational toys of various designs also encourage children's inventiveness. Certain toys that can be manipulated to form various shapes and structures teach children about the creative process. It is, nevertheless, critical for parents to choose age-appropriate toys for their children. Younger children are more likely to be captivated by colorful toys.
